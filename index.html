        <p>I painted this bird on a tent I made. Later I made it sort of glitchy/trippy.</p>

      <div class="baby-sweater">
        <p>For about 6 months, I designed a bunch of baby sweater patterns. Like a lot, 50+ baby sweaters. It turned out to be sort of a dumb idea, but these are the best ones.</p>

      <div class="trash-fashion">
        <p>In 2011 I was invited to participate in a trash fashion show, so I made this fused plastic bag dress and knit this dress out of plastic bag yarn.</p>

      <div class="sheila">
        <p>For several years, I did some production for the artist <a href="http://sheilaklein.com">Sheila Klein</a> under her direction. These are a few detail shots of some of her pieces that I had the opportunity to work on that I am particularly fond of.</p>

      <div class="shirt">
        <p>I made this shirt that is bluetooth controlled and runs on gif based animations. It's pretty neat.</p>

      <div class="vest">
        <p>Shortly after I made that scarf I made this vest, but it was always pretty flickery so I ended up recycling the leds into a different project.</p>

      <div class="leds">
        <p>These are some other led projects I made, because bright blinky things just make the world a happier place.</p>

        <p>I made a persistance of vision kit from Adafruit and messed around with it for awhile, which was fun.</p>

      <div class="pigrrl">
        <p>I also made a pigrrl from another Adafruit kit. It was fun to build but kind of lackluster to play with so I disassembled it and used the components for other projects.</p>
        <img src="images/electronics/pigrrl_01.jpg" alt="The open innards of a pi girl. One half of the case is translucent orange, and contains a few pcb boards. It is connected to a screen, contained in a solid white back case, by a cable ribbon.">

        <p>This was my first e-textile project, done for the Bellingham Foundry</p>

        <p>* I've taught a few workshops to kids using processing, and made this little <a href="https://github.com/stephanie-mason/StuffDraw">paint program</a> as an example for a project.</p>

      <div class="knitting">
        <p>* One day I got super excited about making a <a href="https://github.com/stephanie-mason/KnitSomePants">pants pattern generator</a> for knitters. My enthusiasm was more for the website itself than the actual generator and only lasted for about a day and a half, so I never finished it. But some day I might.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="arduino">
        <p>* Arduino code for led projects. These are all built off of other people's code, mostly from <a href="http://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>.</p>

She has two dogs following her down the path, and at the end of the path is a tiny house on a trailer with her partner, Jason and a few more chickens next to it. There is text at the bottom of the illustration that reads, 'a blog of creative endeavors.'">

  <div id="about">
    <div class="close">Ã—</div>
    <p> My name is Stephanie Mason. I like to try new things and to challenge myself. I am very interested in interdisciplinary work of all kinds. I am especially keen on the intersections between art, science, and design.</p>

    <p>I have worked, for various lengths of time, as a research assistant, a web developer, a knitting store associate, a contortionist, an independent designer, a studio assistant, an artist, a teacher, and a house painter. I currently make a living doing web development at Western Washington University.</p>

    <p>I have a BS in Biology and Mathematics, with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry. I also have an entirely unused BA in Linguistics.</p>

    <p>At this particular moment in my life, I spend most of my free time working on art projects, attending festivals, and playing video games.</p>
