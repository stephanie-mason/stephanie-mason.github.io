THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LINKS SHALL BE AS THUS

Clicking on one link..
  populates images of things that fall under that category
  highlights that link

When a second link is clicked...
    IF THAT LINK has some intersection with the first:
      Then a whole new set of image populates
      AND both links stay selected

    IF NOT
      Then the old link un-hilights
      The new link highlights
      And images populate as if one link is clicked

IF two links are already highlighted, and a third link is clicked...
  If that link is different than one of the first two:
    Then the first two links unhighlight, and this link is treated as clicking on one link

  If that link is one of the first two:
    Then this link becomes the "clicked" link, and the other link gets unhighlighted


The most recently clicked link determines which background image is there, which is the image associated with that link.

CV is the only new html page, which should open in a new tab
About and Contact clear any of the above links and show up separately


ABOUT
My name is Stephanie Mason. I like to try new things and to challenge myself. I am very interested in interdisciplinary work of all kinds. I am especially keen on the intersections between art, science, and design.

I have at turns worked as a research assistant, a web developer, a knitting store associate, an independent designer, a studio assistant, an artist, and a teacher.

I am also a student at Western Washington University, finishing a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and Mathematics with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry. I currently have plans on going to graduate school to work towards getting a PhD. I also have a Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics, because why not.
