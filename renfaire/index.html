          <p>There are a few weekends where we will not be able to meet. During this time, prioritize finishing things in this order:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Finish your bumroll - it will be needed for fitting the skirts</li>
            <li>Start construction on your petticoat. See "<a href="#partlet-petticoat-party">Petticoat Party</a>"</li>
            <li>If you are really gung ho, start construction on the kirtle skirt as well--it is the exact same process as the petticoat and may save time with fitting and such later on</li>
            <li>Complete your corset</li>
            <li>Complete your smock</li>

          <h4>When</h4>
          <p>TBD</p>

          <p>TBD</p>
          <h4>Where</h4>

          <h4>Goal of Session</h4>
          <p>Learn how to make the skirts: How to do different types of pleats, how to fit the skirts, and how to sew it to the waistband. If we have time, let's also cut out the bumrolls this session.</p>

          <h4>Before Session</h4>
          <li>Have your bumroll completed and bring it. You'll need it for the skirt fitting!</li>
          <li>Decide <a href="http://www.elizabethancostume.net/pleats/">what kind of pleating you want to use</a></li>
          <li>Start the skirt ahead of time. Cut out a 3 yard length of your petticoat fabric. Sew the short edges together, so you have a tube. The tube should be 3 yards in circumference and 55" tall. Hem one edge of this tube, which will be the bottom edge. This will make it so at the session we can fit the skirts during the session (excess fabric is cut of of the <b>top</b>, not the bottom.) and get started with the pleating. For more info see <a href="http://www.elizabethancostume.net/petticoat.html#make">the petticoat page on elizabethaconstume.net</a></li>

          <h4>Where</h4>

          <h4>Goal of Session</h4>

          <p>Work on the kirtles. If you haven't already cut out and/or sewn your bodice patern, you can do it here. Figure out how you want to attach your bodice to the skirt (it can be sewn, tied, laced, or attached with hooks and eye) and troubleshoot how to accomplish that. Begin construction on the skirts--it is the exact same process as the petticoats!</p>

          <h4>When</h4>
          <p>Weekend of July 5-7</p>

          <h4>Where</h4>

          <p>Stephanie's Crafting Space</p>
          <h4>Goal of Session</h4>

          <p>Based on experience, it is quite likely that we shall not be as close to being finished with our projects when the deadline is nigh. Lets plan on having an extended session to get as much sewing done as we can, before there is any need to panic! After this session, there will still be 2 whole weeks to finish. Hurrah!</p>
