      <p>As we are all busy gentle women, I propose the following outline for a crafting schedule.</p>

      <p>Each session shall be no more brief than two hours, and no longer than three. Each shall be a focused crafting gathering, for to take advantage of the tools and expertise that each of us may not individually posess.</p>

          <h4>Goals of Session</h4>
          <p>Since we are waiting on materials, we'll use this time to do some drafting. The corset and bodice patterns are fairly similar, and have similar fitting needs so maybe we can feed two bird with one scone this session and make patterns for both.</p

            <p>We also need to schedule the next series of meetings, so bring your calendar!</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Take & record measurements</li>
              <li>Draft corset patterns</li>
              <li>Cut out muslin toile of corsets to check fit</li>
              <li>If time, draft & make toile for bodice patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>When</h4>
            <p>Friday, April 26th at 7pm</p>

            <h4>Where</h4>
            <p>Erica's House</p>

            <h4>Goal of Session</h4>

            <p>Begin construction on the corsets. Use the toile's we made in our first session to cut out the linen pieces. Draw the outlines for the boning. Begin sewing the boning channels to test the fit for the reeds. Cut reeds to size, or at least cut the roll so everyone has some to take home.</p>

            <h4>Bring</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Your prewashed, dyed fabric (whatever color(s) you're making the corset out of). </li>
              <li>You may want to iron it ahead of time as well.</li>
              <li>Toile & Paper pattern from last corset session</li>

          <div class="event-body">
            <h4>When</h4>
            <p>Friday, May 10 at 7pm</p>

            <h4>Where</h4>
            <p>TBD</p>
            
            <h4>Goal of Session</h4>

            <p>At this point our corset should be far enough along that we can try them on. Let's take this opportunity to modify our original corset patterns to create bodice toiles and fit them over the corsets. We can also cut out the pieces for the bumrolls this session, which should be quick and easy. Take home some stuffing.</p>

          <div class="event-body">
            <h4>When</h4>
            <p>Weekend of May 24-26?</p>

            <h4>Where</h4>

            <p>TBD</p>
            <h4>Goal of Session</h4>

            <p>Stephanie will be gone this weekend, but it might be a good opportunity for Rose, Clea, and Erica to catch up on any sewing that needs to be done on smocks, corsets, and bodices. We should probably still schedule something!</p>

            <p>Weekend of June 7-9</p>

            <p>TBD</p>
            <h4>Where</h4>

            <p>TBD - Stephanie's crafting space?</p>
            <h4>Goal of Session</h4>

            <p>Draft and cut out the petticoats. Learn how to construct pleats. After this session, we should have the knowledge necessary to be able to begin construction on the skirt for the kirtle before the next session, so we can focus on fitting the bodices.</p>

            <p>TBD</p>
            <h4>Where</h4>

            <p>TBD - Stephanie's crafting space?</p>
            <h4>Goal of Session</h4>

            <p>Construct the kirtles. We should have bodice toiles ready at this point, so we should be ready to start cutting linen. If possible, come to this session with at least some of the construction done on the skirt portion. Bring your corsets, as they will be important for fitting! We'll also discuss how the bodices can be attached to the skirts.</p>

            <p>Weekend of July 5-7</p>
            
            <h4>Where</h4>

            <p>Stephanie's Crafting Space</p>
            <h4>Goal of Session</h4>

            <p>Based on experience, it is quite likely that we shall not be as close to being finished with our projects when the deadline is nigh. Let us plan on having an extended session to get as much sewing done as we can, before there is any need to panic! After this session, there will still be 2 whole weeks to finish. Hurrah!</p>

        <p>Outside of the main crafting sessions, it would also be nice to get together for more casual crafting sessions for general needlework and handicrafting, both for our costumes and for the goods we will be selling.</p>

        <p>I will be posting here a schedule of roughly planned dates and locations as they arise, feel free to attend any that do not conflict with your schedule and let me know if you would like me to add any dates.</p>
