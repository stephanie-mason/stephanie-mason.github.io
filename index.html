      <div class="outrun-sweater">
        <p>This is my newest design. I created a <a href="http://masonmak.es/synthwave-sweater">page</a> for it that has some basic notes and the charts.</p>
        <img src="images/textiles-design/outrun_sweater.jpg" alt="knit sweater with outrun motifs, including a setting sun, palm trees, and ferraris">

        <p>I also designed this rave onesie. This thing is SIIICK. Not only for the obvious reasons (RAINBOW, UV REACTIVE, FUR HOOD) It has a freaking zipper on the front, so that I don't have to take it off when using porta poties. I just unzip it, pull it up like hiking up a skirt, and am GTG. I didn't make a pattern for this one, but someday I might.</p>

        <p>I had some leftover yarn so I also made a vest for my sister. My BFF also made some things from this yarn for the rest of our festie crew, and dubbed that crew BRITE: Bringing Really Intense Technicolor Ensembles</p>

      <div class="baby-sweater">
        <p>For about 6 months, I designed a bunch of baby sweater patterns. Like a lot, 50+ baby sweaters. It turned out to be sort of a dumb idea, but these are the best ones.</p>

      <div class="trash-fashion">
        <p>In 2011 I was invited to participate in a trash fashion show, so I made this fused plastic bag dress and knit this dress out of plastic bag yarn.</p>

      <div class="furfur">
        <p>A big project in 2018 was this sculpture I made for my camp at OCF. It's named Furfur, it's pretty neato.

      <div class="shirt">
        <p>In 2016 I made this shirt that is bluetooth controlled and runs on gif based animations. It's pretty neat.</p>

      <div class="vest">
        <p>Shortly after I made that scarf I made this vest, but it was always pretty flickery so I ended up recycling the leds into a different project.</p>

      <div class="leds">
        <p>These are some other led projects I made, because bright blinky things just make the world a happier place.</p>

      <div class="pov">
        <p>I made a persistance of vision kit from Adafruit and messed around with it for awhile, which was fun.</p>
        <img src="images/electronics/light-paint-test.jpg" alt="stephanie holds a bright rectangular light in her hand and there is a streak in front of her face with indistinguishable shapes.">

      </div>

      <div class="pigrrl">
        <p>I also made a pigrrl from another Adafruit kit. It was fun to build but kind of lackluster to play with so I disassembled it and used the components for other projects.</p>
        <img src="images/electronics/pigrrl_01.jpg" alt="The open innards of a pi girl. One half of the case is translucent orange, and contains a few pcb boards. It is connected to a screen, contained in a solid white back case, by a cable ribbon.">

        <p>* One day I got super excited about making a <a href="https://github.com/stephanie-mason/KnitSomePants">pants pattern generator</a> for knitters. My enthusiasm was more for the website itself than the actual generator and only lasted for about a day and a half, so I never finished it. But some day I might.</p>

  <div id="about">
    <div class="close">Ã—</div>
    <p> My name is Stephanie Mason. I like to try new things and to challenge myself. I am very interested in interdisciplinary work of all kinds. I am especially keen on the intersections between art, science, and design.</p>

    <p>I have worked, for various lengths of time, as a research assistant, a web developer, a knitting store associate, a contortionist, an independent designer, a studio assistant, an artist, a teacher, and a house painter. I currently make a living doing web development at Western Washington University.</p>

    <p>I have a BS in Biology and Mathematics, with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry. I also have an entirely unused BA in Linguistics.</p>

    <p>At this particular moment in my life, I spend most of my free time working on art projects, attending festivals, and playing video games.</p>
