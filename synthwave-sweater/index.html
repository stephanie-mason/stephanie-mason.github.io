    <h2 class="tagline">I would knit to be with you</h2>

    <section class="intro">
      <p>These notes are intended to clarify some of the details in the sweater I made, and allow for a jumping off point for anyone who happens to be interested in making it. I haven't got the motivation to turn this into a full blown pattern (too much work to scale it to all the necessary sizes and write out all the technical details, when maybe 3 people will have a genuine interest in making it), but these are my build notes in case anyone out there <em>does</em> want to make it. And, while developing the chart and everything for myself, I did a VERY crappy job measuring my gauge the first time and accidentally started out making it way too big. So there are, at least, two different sizes that are charted out and notes for.</p>

      <p>If you are an advanced knitter, you shouldn't have any trouble figuring it out as everything is charted. If you are a novice, you'll need to do some research to make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. I list some <a href="#techniques">techniques</a> that you'll want to know about before diving in.</p>

      <p><strong>If you are asking someone to make this sweater for you</strong>, make sure that you are <em>really</em> special to them and do something <em>really</em> nice in return for their efforts. And don't be surprised if they tell you to gfy, because this is a big ask.</p>

        <li>3 (3.25mm) - used for stockinette sections</li>
        <li>4 (3.5mm) - used for stranded sections</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <section class="notes">

      <h3>Gauge</h3>
      <p>On size 3 needles, plain stockinette:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>6.5 sts per inch (26 per 10cm)</li>
        <li>9 rows per inch (36 per 10cm)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sizing</h3>
      <p>There are charts and notes for two (very different) sizes: small (34" chest circumference) and large (44" chest circumference)</p>

      <p>For funsies, I made it so this page only shows one size at a time. You can switch it by clicking one of these guys:</p>

      <ul class="horizontal-list">
        <li><button class="toggle-small active" href="#">Small</button></li>
        <li><button class="toggle-large" href="#">Large</button></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Finished Measurements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chest: <span class="small">33" (84 cm)</span><span class="large">44" (112 cm)</span> circumference</li>
        <li>Length: 22" (56 cm) from shoulder to hem</li>
        <li>Sleeve length: 18" (46 cm) from underarm</li>
      </ul>

      TODO: include photo of finished sweater with measurements

      <h3>Special Stitches</h3>
      <h4>Twisted rib</h4>
      <p>I knit the hem, cuffs, and collar using twisted rib which keeps them nice and tight. Twisted rib is like regular k1, p1 rib, except you work the knit stitches through the back loop.</p>

      <h4>Clean stripes on ribbed sections</h4>
      <p>When knitting stripes in ribbing, you can get little jagged edges. To prevent this: when changing colors, first row with the new color is worked by knitting all the way across. Then continue in twisted rib for the remaining rows of that color.</p>

      <h3 id="techniques">Techniques Used</h3>
      <p>As this isn't a pattern, I don't go over in great detail how to construct each part of this sweater. These are the techniques that I employed. If you get stuck, try doing an internet search on one of these to figure out what to do, or look for patterns on Ravelry that have these characteristics. The people who wrote those patterns usually go into a lot of detail on how to do these techniques.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stranded knitting</li>
        <li>Steeking</li>
        <li>Knitting in the round</li>
        <li>German twisted cast on</li>
        <li>Sewn bind off (collar)</li>
        <li>Set in sleeves</li>
        <li>Short row shaping</li>
        <li>TODO:Either: embroidery or chain surface stitching...</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Body</h2>
    <section class="pattern-body">
      <div class="chart">
        <img src="synthwave-sweater/sweater-chart-front_thumbnail.png" alt="front sweater chart">
      </div>

      <div class="chart">
        <img src="synthwave-sweater/sweater-chart-back_thumbnail.png" alt="back sweater chart">
      </div>

      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p><span class="small">212</span><span class="large">284</span> sts are cast on — <span class="small">106</span><span class="large">142</span> front and <span class="small">106</span><span class="large">142</span> back.</p>

      <p>The body is worked in the round from the bottom up according to the charts.</p>

      <h4>Chart notes</h4>
      <p>The first 24 rows of the chart (shown as lighter purple, although it is also worked in main color) are worked in twisted rib using smaller needles, then switch to larger needles for the remainder of the chart.</p>

      <p>The mountain sections (shown in darker blue, though also worked in turquoise) are not knit, but are (TODO: embroidered? ch stitched?) after the fact. When knitting, these sections are worked in stockinette stitch with the main color.</p>

      <p>Note: to make the bottom of this sweater longer or shorter, the bottom mountain section is the easiest place to do it. Just knit a few more or a few less stockinette rows here.</p>

      <p>The shaping for the set in sleeves can either be done by creating steeks, or by working that section flat. There aren't <em>that</em> many stranded rows, so I just worked them flat.</p>

      <p>The neckline can be shaped either with short rows or by binding off on rows that have multiple decreases across a single row.</p>

      <h4>Collar</h4>
      <p>After the top is finished, the shoulders need to be seamed.</p>

      <p>Then, using smaller needles, <span class="small">132</span><span class="large">162</span> stitches are picked up and up to be knit around the neckline. These stitches are picked up starting 4 stitches from the center front, with the last 8 stitches picked up overlapping the first 8.</p>

      <p>15 rows are worked in twisted rib, alternating between pink and purple every 3 rows. Decrease 1 stitch at the beginning and end of each row for the last 4 rows to create the rounded edge.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Sleeves</h2>
    <section class="pattern-sleeve">
      <div class="chart">
        <img src="synthwave-sweater/sleeve_thumbnail.png" alt="back sweater chart">
      </div>

      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>Sleeves worked from bottom up. They can be worked in the round, but the sleeve cap should be worked flat.</p>

      <h4>Cuffs</h4>
      <p>60 sts are cast on.</p>

      <p>As with the body, the first 24 rows of the chart (shown as lighter purple, although it is also worked in main color) are worked in twisted rib using smaller needles, then switch to larger needles for the remainder of the sleeve.</p>

      <h4>Increases</h4>
      <p>Starting with the first stockinette row, increase rows are worked every <span class="small">14</span><span class="large">7</span> rows until there are <span class="small">78</span><span class="large">96 stitches</span>. Increase at both the beginning and end of each increase row.</p>

      <h4>Sleeve cap</h4>
      <p><span class="small">8</span><span class="large">16</span> stitches are bound off for the underarm — <span class="small">4</span><span class="large">9</span> on each side of the center. The remainder of the sleeve is worked back and forth, decrease according to the chart.</p>

      <h4>Seaming</h4>
      <p>The sleeves need to be sewn on to the body. Obviously.</p>
